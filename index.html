										The United Nations (UN) is the largest international
										organization, comprising of 193 Member States. It acts as a
										forum for international cooperation to support world peace.
										The UN was officially established on October 24, 1945 (now
										known as United Nations Day), after the end of the Second
										World War. <br />
										<br />
										The UN’s operations are guided by the principles outlined in
										the UN Charter. They include maintaining international peace
										and security, developing friendly relations among nations,
										achieving international cooperation in solving international
										problems, and being a centre for harmonizing the actions of
										nations. <br />
										<br />
										The UN Charter was signed on June 26, 1945, in San Francisco
										and serves as the cornerstone document for the organization.
										Under the UN Charter, there are six main bodies or organs
										that guide the UN: the General Assembly, the Security
										Council, the Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship
										Council, the International Court of Justice, and the United
										Nations Secretariat.<br />
										<br />
										In addition to the UN Charter, world leaders decided to
										create a document that would accompany the UN Charter and
										guarantee the rights of every individual everywhere. This
										document is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
										was adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948,
										and contains 30 articles on human rights.<br />
										<br />
										The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been
										translated into over 500 languages, serves as a standard for
										evaluating ethical conduct and establishing a foundation for
										fair and equal treatment. It guarantees universal
										fundamental human rights for all and provides individuals
										worldwide with a powerful instrument in their struggle
										against oppression, injustice, and violations of human
										rights.<br />

										A declaration is formal statement or document issued by a
										government or an international organization promoting a
										common goal and expressing shared beliefs, principles,
										values, or commitments. Two notable examples of this are the
										<a

											>Universal Declaration of Human Rights </a

											>United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
											Peoples</a
										>. <br /><br />
										In the UN, declarations are approved by the UN General
										Assembly but are not legally enforceable. This is because
										the UN General Assembly does not have the legislative powers
										to create international law. In other words, declarations
										are not law.
										<br /><br />
										While declarations themselves may lack legal enforcement,
										they can influence the development of treaties or
										conventions, or lead to the enactment of new legislation (or
										the amendment of previous legislation) within a country or
										state.

										The UN Declaration is a globally recognized comprehensive
										international human rights instrument that contains 46
										articles on the collective and individual rights of
										Indigenous Peoples. Article 43 states that the rights of
										Indigenous Peoples in the UN Declaration are the minimum
										standards to contribute to their survival, dignity and
										well-being.
										<br /><br />
										The UN Declaration is the result of almost 25 years of work
										and collaboration between UN member states and Indigenous
										Peoples from around the world. Indigenous leaders from
										Canada played a significant role in its development,
										including drafting and negotiations.
										<br /><br />
										The UN Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly in
										2007, although it wasn’t endorsed by the Government of
										Canada until May 2016.

										Both the UN Declaration and the Universal Declaration of
										Human Rights are vital. The Universal Declaration of Human
										Rights applies universally to all people in the world, while
										the UN Declaration offers specific guidance to address the
										unique needs and rights of Indigenous Peoples.
										<br />
										The UN Declaration recognizes Indigenous Peoples’ unique
										historical and cultural contexts. It interprets and explains
										the human rights of Indigenous Peoples through an Indigenous
										lens and covers all areas of human rights as they relate to
										Indigenous communities, including:
									</p>
									<br />
									<ul>
										<li>
											<strong>Racism and discrimination:</strong> Addresses
											racism and discrimination, which involves acknowledging
											the inherent dignity and value of Indigenous Peoples and
											individuals.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Self-determination:</strong> Enables Indigenous
											communities to have autonomy in managing their own
											matters.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Participation in decision-making:</strong> Makes
											sure their voices are taken into account in issues that
											impact them.
										</li>
										<li>
											<strong>Respect for and protection of culture:</strong>
											Safeguards Indigenous traditions, cultures, languages, and
											heritage.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<br />
									<p>
										The UN Declaration is a component of the broader UN human
										rights framework, which includes nine fundamental
										international human rights treaties. These treaties also
										safeguard and pertain to Indigenous Peoples. Collectively,
										these declarations advocate for justice, equality, and
										respect for all individuals.

										The UN Declaration addresses both the individual and

										critical standards for preserving Indigenous rights to
										contribute to their survival, dignity, and well-being.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Individual rights</strong></p>
									<p>
										There are other rights that apply to individuals, and there
										are rights that are both individual and collective. The
										right to security of the person, which includes the right to
										live free from violence, is a right that every individual
										has. But in the UN Declaration context, there is also a
										collective right to security, so this right is both
										individual and collective.
									</p>
									<p><strong>Collective rights</strong></p>
									<p>
										Indigenous Peoples have the collective right to live in
										freedom, peace and security as distinct peoples and the
										right not to be subjected to any act of genocide or any
										other act of violence, including forcibly removing children
										of the group to another group.

										Long before the arrival of European and other settlers,
										Indigenous Peoples in what is now Canada had established
										their own unique forms of governance. These governance
										structures reflected the diverse economic, social, and
										geographic aspects of Indigenous communities, incorporating
										their cultural practices and spiritual beliefs. Initially,
										partnerships between colonial governments and Indigenous
										nations were established through treaties, trade, and
										military alliances. However, over the course of many
										centuries, these relationships deteriorated due to
										successive laws, policies, and decisions that adopted a
										colonial and paternalistic approach. <br /><br />One
										significant example is the <em>Indian Act</em>, enacted in
										1876, which continues to shape the governance of most First
										Nations in Canada today. The <em>Indian Act</em> imposed a
										colonial system of governance on First Nation communities,
										wherein authority rested with the federal minister,
										contributing to the erosion of Indigenous autonomy over
										time. <br /><br />Canada recognizes that Indigenous Peoples
										have an inherent right of self-government guaranteed in
										section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and articles 3 and
										4 of the UN Declaration.
									</p>
									<p>Article 3</p>
									<ul id="article">
										<li>
											Indigenous peoples have the right to self-determination.
											By virtue of that right they freely determine their
											political status and freely pursue their economic, social
											and cultural development.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>Article 4</p>

									<ul>
										<li>
											Indigenous peoples, in exercising their right to
											self-determination, have the right to autonomy or
											self-government in matters relating to their internal and
											local affairs, as well as ways and means for financing
											their autonomous functions.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										The meaning of self-determination differs among First
										Nations, Métis, Inuit, and Indigenous organizations,
										academics, and researchers. Although there is no universally
										accepted definition of Indigenous self-determination,
										certain overarching themes emerge when discussing the
										concept.
									</p>
									<p>
										A central feature of self-determination is Indigenous
										Peoples regaining control over their own lands and
										resources. Instruments facilitating self-determination
										include comprehensive land claim agreements, self-government
										agreements, and First Nation land management agreements.
									</p>
									<p>
										Additionally, there is an agreement on the importance of
										direct engagement and the duty to consult with Indigenous
										Peoples when activities have the potential to impact
										existing Indigenous or treaty rights. Furthermore,
										self-determination involves a commitment to acknowledge and
										promote Indigenous Peoples' jurisdiction or
										self-determination as a fundamental element of effective,
										credible, and responsible governance.

										<strong>Human rights:</strong> Human rights are the rights
										we all have by virtue of being human. They include things
										like the right to self-determination. The UN Declaration is
										an international human rights instrument that strives to
										articulate and protect the inherent rights of Indigenous
										Peoples.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Inherent rights:</strong> Prior to colonization,
										Indigenous Peoples exercised their sovereignty as nations
										with their own laws, governments, cultures, and economies.
										Lands and territories were owned collectively, with
										responsibilities to be caretakers of the land and to share
										it with plants and animals. Inherent rights are all of these
										rights that Indigenous Peoples have always had since time
										immemorial. These include collective rights to
										self-determination, to land and territory, and to culture.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Treaty rights:</strong> Treaties are agreements
										between nations, between Indigenous Peoples and Canada.
										Treaties are meant to uphold inherent rights. But not all
										treaties are the same, and treaties can have both positive
										and negative impacts on human rights. Treaty rights are
										recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the Constitution.
									</p>
									<p>
										<strong>Constitutional rights:</strong> The Constitution is
										the supreme law of Canada. Section 35 of the Constitution
										recognizes and affirms existing Aboriginal and treaty
										rights, which are based on inherent rights. The Constitution
										does many things, including affirming human rights in
										Canadian law. It is a tool that impacts how human rights are
										respected, protected, and upheld in Canada. The Constitution
										can have positive and negative impacts on human rights.
									</p>
									<p>
										When you are using the word “rights,” keep in mind which
										rights you are talking about. For the sake of clarity, it
										may help to say inherent rights, constitutional rights,
										treaty rights, or human rights instead of just “rights.”

										The Act provides a framework to advance implementation of

										Constitution. It ensures sustained efforts to uphold the
										human rights of Indigenous Peoples now and in the future,
										and contains measures to hold the federal government

										The Government of Canada has a constitutional duty to
										consult Indigenous Peoples when it considers measures that
										might adversely impact their potential or established
										Aboriginal or treaty rights. This has been consistently
										confirmed by the courts. The duty to consult can also be set
										out in legislation or modern treaties. The Government of
										Canada has consistently worked to uphold this duty and has
										shown its commitment to taking additional steps to do so.

										<br />
										<br />

										The implementation of the Act will inform how the government
										approaches meeting this legal duty going forward, providing
										greater clarity and creating greater certainty for
										Indigenous groups and all Canadians. However, the Act itself
										does not immediately change Canada’s existing duty to
										consult Indigenous groups, or other consultation and
										participation requirements set out in legislation like the

										Article 19 of the UN Declaration declares that “States shall
										consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous
										peoples concerned through their own representative
										institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and
										informed consent before adopting and implementing
										legislative or administrative measures that may affect
										them.”
									</p>
									<ul st>
										<li>
											<strong>Free</strong>: This implies that consent should be
											granted without any form of manipulation, coercion, or
											intimidation. Indigenous communities must have the
											autonomy to make decisions without external influence or
											pressure.
										</li>
										<p></p>

										<li>
											<strong>Prior</strong>: Prior to any authorization or
											commencement of activities, consent should be sought with
											sufficient advance notice. It is crucial to respect the
											time requirements of consultation and consensus processes.
										</li>
										<p></p>
										<li>
											<strong>Informed</strong>: Indigenous communities have the
											right to receive comprehensive information regarding any
											initiatives that impact their lands and resources. This
											includes projects related to minerals, water, the
											environment, and other resources. They should be informed
											in a timely manner and have the chance to give their
											consent before any development or action commences.
										</li>
										<p></p>

										<li>
											<strong>Consent</strong>: Consent refers to voluntarily
											and willfully agreeing to something in response to another
											person’s proposition. It involves giving assent or
											approval. When someone consents, they comply or yield to a
											request or proposal.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										In everyday terms, the principle of free, prior, and
										informed consent dictates that governments and other
										entities cannot enact policies or programs concerning
										Indigenous Peoples’ lands unless they have consulted with
										and obtained consent from the Indigenous community. This
										principle is in alignment with Indigenous Peoples’ inherent
										right to self-determination. As the

											href="https://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/csj-sjc/principles-principes.html"
											>Principles Respecting the Government of Canada’s
											Relationship with Indigenous Peoples</a
										>
										note, free, prior and informed consent builds on and goes
										beyond the legal duty to consult. For example, modern
										treaties have been described as an example of free, prior
										and informed consent in action.
									</p>
									<p>
										Free, prior, and informed consent serves as a crucial
										safeguard, ensuring that Indigenous voices are acknowledged
										and respected in decisions that affect their lives and
										territories.
